# 1. $CALDP_HOME or `pwd` is mounted as /home/developer
#     inside Docker, and is r/w.
# 2. $CRDS_PATH (or /grp/crds/cache) is mounted if visible natively, readonly.
#
# To support use of AWS, consider copying or linking ~/.aws into whatever
# native directory you mount at /home/developer.
#
# If $CALDP_HOME is defined in the environment, mount that directory at
# /home/developer when Docker is run. By default, when $CALDP_HOME is not
# defined, mount the current working directory at /home/developer inside the
# container.  If CALDP_HOME is set to "none" then don't mount anything.
#
# Paths specified on the command line are interpreted within the context of the
# running container.  Hence relative paths are relative to /home/developer
# and/or relative to whatever native directory is mounted at /home/developer.
